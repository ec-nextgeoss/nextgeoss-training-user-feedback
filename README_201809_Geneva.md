Topic 5 - Integration of geospatial user feedback applied to data resources (quality, fit for purpose)

The objective of this hands on is to illustrate how to include the Geospatial User Feedback (GUF) mechanims in community catalogues. We will simulate the existance of a catalogue that we can manipulate using the corine.htm (extracted from the copernicus land service: https://land.copernicus.eu/pan-european/corine-land-cover/clc-2012?tab=metadata). The corine.htm page represents a resource that we have discovered in a catalogue and we want to be able to provide feedback about it. Do be able to do that, we will add the GUF widget using the procedure indicated in the instructions provided en the NiMMBus GitHub page. Note that the two first entries in the corine.htm are the _code_ and the _codespace_ that we need for linking the metadata (and the data) to the GUF.

Please transform corine.htm into something that has the GUF widget integrated without taking a look at the result. NEvertheless, if you do not know how to cotinue and get stack, you can pike a look at corine_wt_guf.htm (elavorated during the Setp.11th 2018 training). 

General information about the GUF can be found in [the nimmbus GitHub](https://github.com/joanma747/nimmbus)

The instructions to integrate the GUF can be found in [the nimmbus integration GitHub page](https://github.com/joanma747/nimmbus/tree/master/GUF_integration)
